This is a Python project.

--git diff: difference between the README.md file on HEAD and README.md file in local
--git blame: shows who was the last person and when did the person make changes to a commit
--git -v: check the remote repositories conected
--git remote remove origin: deletes connected origin(alias) remote repository
--git -u origin master: add remote origin(alias) repository
--git log: only show log of local repository, to check remote -> git log origin/master

More than one remote repositories can be added (named differently, for example: origin&backup).

In GitHub there is more detailed description for commits, which is the body of the commit, should describe what happened in the commit, HEADER is just the title of it.

When using git status and "diverged" message displays, means when merging the two branch will have conflict.
